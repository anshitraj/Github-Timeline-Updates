Great work finishing the project! Here's a professional and clear `README.md` file tailored for your **GH Timeline Email Verification** PHP project:

---

```markdown
# 📬 GH Timeline - Email Verification & GitHub Notifications

This is a PHP-based email verification system that registers users using their email, sends a verification code, and subscribes them to GitHub timeline updates. A CRON job fetches the latest GitHub activity every 5 minutes and emails updates to verified users.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Email-based registration and verification
- ✅ Stores verified emails in a local file (`registered_emails.txt`)
- ✅ Fetches GitHub timeline updates using GitHub API
- ✅ Sends timeline updates via email to all verified users
- ✅ CRON job integration for automatic updates (every 5 minutes)
- ❌ No third-party libraries or services used (as per assignment rules)
